## üöÄ Overview

The `dlfinal` project is a Python application that utilizes FastAPI, LangChain, and OpenCV to create a conversational AI system. This system allows users to interact with a chat model using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Gradio. The chat model is powered by Google GenAI's Chat API and OpenAI's Chat API, enabling users to engage in natural language conversations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* Conversational AI system with a GUI interface built using Gradio
* Integration with Google GenAI's Chat API and OpenAI's Chat API for chat model capabilities
* Support for loading environment variables from a .env file
* Video capture and image encoding using OpenCV
* Image processing using PIL
* Support for displaying HTML widgets in Jupyter notebooks using IPython
